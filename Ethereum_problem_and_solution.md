# Contract isn't deploying with truffle, showing "Network up to date on truffle deploy"..
Ans. If you try to deploy the same contract again it without changes it wont let you because you will deploy contract that is the same as the one you deployed before.You can also force a redeploy by running `truffle deploy --reset`
